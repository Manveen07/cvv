    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="intro">Hi, my name is Manveen, and I'm a college student of Msit(janak-puri) who is passionate about learning and programming with Python. I started my journey into the world of programming by learning the basics of programming with Java, but I soon realized that Python is a more versatile and beginner-friendly language that can be used for a wide range of applications. Since then, I have been dedicating my time to mastering Python and exploring its many applications, from web development to data analysis and machine learning. I enjoy taking on coding challenges and working on personal projects, and I'm always eager to learn more about Python and how I can use it to create innovative solutions. Through my experiences with Python, I have discovered a deep appreciation for the power of technology and its ability to shape the world we live in.</p>
